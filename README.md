- Handled missing values and outliers appropriately.
- Standardized data types for analysis.

### Task 2: Descriptive Analysis

**Objective:**
- Perform descriptive statistics to understand dataset characteristics.

**Key Activities:**
- Calculated summary statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.) for numerical variables.
- Created frequency tables and histograms to visualize distributions.
- Analyzed correlations between variables to identify initial insights.

### Task 3: Geospatial Analysis

**Objective:**
- Analyze restaurant data using geospatial techniques.

**Key Activities:**
- Plotted restaurant locations on maps to visualize distribution.
- Conducted spatial clustering to identify restaurant hotspots.
- Analyzed spatial relationships between restaurant locations and ratings.

## Level 2: Advanced Analysis and Feature Engineering

### Task 1: Table Booking and Online Delivery

**Objective:**
- Analyze the availability and impact of table booking and online delivery options.

**Key Activities:**
- Calculated percentages of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery.
- Compared average ratings between restaurants with and without table booking.
- Visualized online delivery availability across different price ranges.

### Task 2: Price Range Analysis

**Objective:**
- Analyze the distribution and impact of different price ranges on restaurant ratings.

**Key Activities:**
- Identified the most common price range among restaurants.
- Calculated average ratings for each price range.
- Determined the highest-rated price range and visualized findings.

### Task 3: Feature Engineering

**Objective:**
- Enhance predictive modeling capabilities through feature extraction and engineering.

**Key Activities:**
- Extracted new features such as restaurant name length and address details.
- Created binary features like "Has Table Booking" and "Has Online Delivery."
- Prepared data for advanced modeling techniques.

## Level 3: Predictive Modeling and Advanced Insights

### Task 1: Predictive Modeling

**Objective:**
- Build regression models to predict restaurant ratings based on available features.

**Key Activities:**
- Developed regression models using algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, and random forest.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as RMSE and R-squared.
- Fine-tuned models to improve predictive accuracy.

### Task 2: Customer Preference Analysis

**Objective:**
- Analyze customer preferences for restaurant cuisines and their impact on ratings.

**Key Activities:**
- Investigated relationships between cuisine types and average ratings.
- Identified popular cuisines based on customer votes.
- Explored correlations between cuisine preferences and ratings.

### Task 3: Data Visualization

**Objective:**
- Create visualizations to communicate insights from data analysis effectively.

**Key Activities:**
- Designed visualizations such as histograms and bar plots to represent rating distributions.
- Compared average ratings across different cuisines or cities using graphical representations.
- Visualized relationships between features (e.g., cuisine type, location) and restaurant ratings.
